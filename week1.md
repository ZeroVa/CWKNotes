##Welcome
Welcome to _Intro to Game Design and Development_, and 8-week course from Code Writing Kids! From this course, you'll learn to make computer games using **Game Maker Studio**, a program from YoYoGames, Inc. You'll also be learning concepts behind computer programming, disguised as fun video game design! We'll start with the basics on a drag and drop interface, and move onto more advanced concepts using Game Maker's scripting language. We'll look not only at what makes a game, but also what makes a **fun** game. You don't need to have any prior experience with game development or programming for this course!

In the first 4 weeks of the course, we'll learn the basics of Game Maker and make a few games. Once we get past the basics, each of you will begin work on your very own games, built from scratch, over the next 4 weeks. By the end of the class you will have a videogame of your very own, built using the skills techniques you've learned in this class.

If you have questions during the week or outside of class, feel free to email me at **ahsan.zahid@outlook.com**.

Today, we'll focus on getting settled in with Game Maker, learning how to create the building blocks of games, and create a simple game by the end of class today!


##Understanding goals
You'll be able to understand:
 - what a game *is*
 - the building blocks of a game in Game Maker (rooms, sprites, objects, etc)
 - what it means for our code to be *even-driven*
 - the GM Coordinate system
 - the difference between *speed* and *gravity/acceleration*

##Skill goals
You'll be able to perform the following tasks:

 - Navigate the GM interface
 - Create sprites, rooms, objects, etc in Game Maker
 - Assign sprites to objects
 - Add Event listeners to objects
 - Manipulate objects with drag/drop action blocks
 - Add controllable movement (walking/jumping) to objects
 - Arrange objects in a room
 - Test your code iteratively

##Points to Remember

 - Games are programs that let users interact with graphics on-screen to try and achieve some kind of goal.
 - Using key-shortcuts can make programming faster
 - Add prefixes (obj, spr, snd) to the names you choose, since you might want to give related things the same name.
 - We're working in GM's *basic* mode. Later we'll type code out in scripts.
 - Rooms hold objects, objects wear sprites.
 - Without sprites, objects are invisible.
 - Objects listen for certain events to happen, and react with actions
 - Speed is how fast. Gravity is how fast something **gets faster**.
 - The coordinate (0,0) is the **top-left**. Forward is x gets bigger moving **forward**, and y gets bigger moving **down**

## Don't forget...

 - You can create an object/sprite/etc two ways:
	 1. Right click the appropriate folder and click the "Create" option

	 2. Click the appropriate button from the top menu bar

 - Open options menus for objects/sprites/etc by double-clicking them
 - To change an object's sprite, click the menu button in the 'Sprite' box in the **object's menu**

 - To edit events, open the objects options menu, and click 'add event'. Then choose the event you want to add.

##After Class
Follow [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsfSbHrA7uY) to make a platformer game from start to finish, at home!

Either find sprites from the internet, or make your own sprites. This will help you become more comfortable with Game Maker and its interface, and you'll have made a cool game to add to your portfolio!
