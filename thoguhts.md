# Rough Notes for 8-week Course
---

So, the course is **8** weeks long. Meetings are every Saturday, from 2 PM to 4 PM. Topic is **Video game design**.

##Goals
Here are the broad goals for the course.

* Learn to use Game Maker
* Learn the basics of Object Oriented Programming
* Discuss what makes a **game**
  * Sprites
  * Objects
  * Rooms
  * Events
  * Actions
  * Alarms
  * Simple scripting
  * Coordinate systems
  * Gravity vs 'speed'
  * Collisions
  * Possibly simple AI
  * Simple physics
* Discuss what makes a game **fun**
  * Adding difficulty
  * Enemy objects
  * Static and moving obstacles
  * Goals/checkpoints
  * Items
  * HP/damage
* Plan gameplay and mechanics
* Design levels on paper, then design in software
* Discuss different genres of games
  * Platformers
  * Top-down shooters
  * RPG/adventure
  * Puzzle
  * Point/click
  * etc
* Learn to use and animate sprites
	* Import from spritesheets
	* Animation
	* Design from within GM
	* Pixel measurements
	* Framerates and animation speeds
	* Collision masks
* Adding sound to a game
* Polishing the game
* Publishing/exporting/sharing the game

##Tentative Schedule

Meetings are planned for:

* November 15, 22, 29
* December 6, 13, 20, 27
* January 3

The first half of the course **(Weeks 1-4)** will focus on familiarizing students with the **basic functionality** and interface of Game Maker, to the point that they are ready to start writing games from scratch. Each week, students will follow an in-class tutorial to create one game, and spend the week either adding a feature of their own to the game, or following along with another tutorial to create a similar game on their own at home. These games will explore different genres (platformers, top-down shooters, etc). Along with weekly at-home tutorials, students will have a simple, weekly 'quiz' to refresh their memory of the in-class lecture. These will be graded and assessed every week, so that students keep up with coursework.

The second half **(Weeks 5 to 8)** will involve students planning and coding their own games. Students will begin thinking about what makes a game **FUN**, as well as learning more advanced features in Game Maker, including Game Maker Language (GML) scripting, use of variables, hitpoint (HP) systems, etc. By the end of the course, students will have several games created using tutorials, as well as one original game of their own making. Homework for the second half of the class will be work on their own game. At the final class meeting, students will present their games in front of the class, with possibly judging/awards.

The following videos will be used as resources. Some will be assigned, others will be optional for students to go through.
