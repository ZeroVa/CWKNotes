##Making Things Pretty!
Now that we've taken a look at setting up rooms and views, and we know how to craft the objects, events, and actions of our games, it's the perfect time to start working on making our games _look_ pretty! We do this through the use of **sprites**.

##Understanding goals
You'll be able to understand:

- that sprites are the visual elements that represent objects in a game
- that transformations are applied according to a sprite's origin
- how framerates work for sprites
- how sprites are animated with frames
- the idea of transparency in sprites


##Skill goals
You'll be able to perform the following tasks:

- Set the origin of a sprite for better transform controls
- Import sprites from spritesheets
- Apply transformations to sprites
- Change which sprite an object is using

##Points to Remember

- Spritesheets have background colors not used by the sprite
- You can remove the background color from the sprite and sprites will be smooth on other backgrounds.
- Sprites can also be used as buttons.
- Sprites belong to people who create them.
- If you want to sell a game, you need to own the sprites, or have permission to use them.
- You can make your own sprites! Use pain, photoshop, even the little paint-like tool in Game Maker!
- PNG files are generally better for sprites, as JPEG files blur sprites a bit.

## Don't forget...

- Change a sprite's origin from the sprite menu, if you need to.

- Double click a frame/image in a sprite, and you'll see Game Maker's built-in image editor

- Use the 'Change Sprite' action under the main1 tab to change which sprite an object uses.

## After Class
Alright, now find a spritesheet, cut it up into seprate animated sprites, and get one of your game's objects to proprly switch between sprites.
Also, make a simple "start game" button sprite, make an object, put it in  new rom, and use the click action to switch rooms. Basically, make a simple 'start screen' or game menu! This will serve to polish up your game, and also give you a reasonable place to go after the user loses your game (instead of just restarting the level).
