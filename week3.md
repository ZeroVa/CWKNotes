##Make Some Room!
Last time we focused on objects, and how to make objects do things with events and actions. This time, we're going to look at rooms! The game, after all, happens in rooms. We're also going to take a deeper look at sprites, since that's how the user can see anything in the game.

##Understanding goals
You'll be able to understand:

 - the ways rooms are used in games (menus, levels, etc)
 - the coordinate and direction system used in Game Maker
 - the difference between the room and the user's viewport
 - the usage of sprites
 - sprite transparency

##Skill goals
You'll be able to perform the following tasks:

 - Setting room dimensions
 - Arranging objects into rooms in layers
 - Showing only part of the room at once
 - Setting viewports to follow objects
 - How to set backgrounds for rooms
 - Animating room backgrounds
 - How to switch betwen rooms
 - How to end the game after the last room

##Points to Remember

 - Rooms can be used as menu screens as well as levels
 - Rooms can be used as logical divisions in your games. 
 - Keep room design clear.
 - Use viewports wisely. Experiment with what looks good.
 - Sometimes you can use parallax tricks and other objects moving rather than super long rooms.
 - Huge room dimensions aren't always bad: you can set a smaller viewport.
 - Be careful when importing sprites from sheets! Proper transparency is important.

## Don't forget...

 - Change a sprite's origin from the sprite menu, if you need to.

 - You can change the room dimensions from the settings tab in the room options menu

 - Work with Views from the Views tab. You'll need to enable views from here to actually use them.

## After Class
Now, go back to the platformer you made in week 1, and add a nice background or some tiles to it! Make it pretty! Maybe even extend it, and use a view that will follow the character object. Make it into an adventure!
